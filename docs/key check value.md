The key check value (abbreviated KCV or CV) of a DES/3DES key is the result of encrypting 16 hexadecimal zeroes using the key. For example, the key check value of the single-length DES key 0123456789ABCDEF is equal to D5D44FF720683D0D. This information is useful when transmitting DES/3DES keys in an encrypted fashion and is usually send by the sender to ensure that the recipient has correctly received the key.
